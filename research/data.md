## AJILE12: Long-term Naturalistic Human Intracranial Neural Recordings and Pose

AJILE12 (_Annotated Joints in Long-term Electrocorticography for 12 human participants_) is a multimodal human electrocorticography (ECoG) dataset recorded during passive clinical epilepsy monitoring. The dataset includes synchronized intracranial neural recordings and upper body pose trajectories across 55 semi-continuous days of naturalistic movements from 12 human participants.
