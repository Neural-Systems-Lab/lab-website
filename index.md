Research in the Neural Systems Lab at the University of Washington focuses on understanding the brain using computational models and simulations, and applying this knowledge to the task of developing human-like artificial intelligence (AI) and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). We utilize data and techniques from a variety of fields, ranging from neuroscience, cognitive science and psychology to artificial intelligence, machine learning and statistics. Current efforts are focused on:
- Hierarchical, dynamic and active predictive coding and related probabilistic models to understand the brain,
- Neuroscience-inspired general AI frameworks for vision, robotics and reinforcement learning, and
- BCIs and brain co-processors that utilize AI to interact with brain circuits to restore and augment human function.
